# Personal Learnings

## 1.Mobile first design

To be honest I never liked the idea of mobile first design but once you get the hang of it, you realize that creating the desired design becomes much easier. I will definitely start usign the mobile first design more often.

## 2. Responsive design

I was really afraid of the term responsive design before.
It would always sound like a hard thing to do but now that I had this project that gave me an opportunity to develop my responsive design skills, I'm starting to like responsive design and I realized that it is a must known skill if you want to become a Web Developer.

## 3. Using the inspector more

The inspector is such an important tool. It makes your work much easier. In my opinion, knowing how to use the inspector is very important and a crucial part of being a productive Web Developer.

# My notes about the project

Building this project was so much fun. It was such a solid project and I feel like I learned a lot from it. I also enjoyed completing the stretch goals. The fixed navbar was good for developing more CSS3 skills. The "add to cart" button was a very good exercise as well.
